Hi, I am Chinmay Shrivastava. I currently work at [Adaptive Tech.](https://adaptive.live/) as a Solutions Engineer.

I am a mechanical engineer by training (**IIT Roorkee**'21) experienced in Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing. I have worked on projects ranging from computational simulations of Dielectric Elastomers (DEM) to Deep Q-Learning. I have also designed and trained a variety of algorithms including Knowledge Graphs and Multiagent Systems. I also hold a Master's from **Brown University** (2022).

_Currently, I am working on Multiagent systems and on auto-tuning of AI chains/pipelines to scale them for complex tasks._
