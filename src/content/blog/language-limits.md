# What is Language?

Language is the great enabler. It is a technology that lets humans preserve and share thoughts and ideas (or knowledge) across time and space. It enables us to
accummulate wisdom over time, even when the original thinker has turned to dust. It enables us to capture complex thoughts and ideas into words, like "serendipity"
and "zeitgeist". And, it enables us to imagine things and believe in them even when lacking evidence, e.g. god, money, nation, companies, etc. Language can also be
considered wealth, the more of which you understand, the better ideas you can have, and the better things you can build and implement. Try imagining abstract concepts
like money, or democracy, or capitalism without those very words. Furthermore, it enabled recursive abstraction, where we are able to train AI models purely on Language
and which in turn feed new abstract concepts back into us.

But, is Language an end unto itself?

I would say no.

# Cognitive Complexity

Language is a lossy compression of the complex ideas and visions that human mind conjurs up. The same sentence can lead to semantically similar, but vastly different
understanding and visions for two different readers. Human mind works in high-fidelity, language holds little to no meaning without the abstractions of the mind that lead
to visions, abstract thinking, transfer learning, spatial understanding, and critical thinking among others.

It's this high fidelity information, and processing happening inside the human mind that is then translated into scientific maturity, and curiosity, which are enabling
factors for world changing innovations. Think about [Kekule dreaming about ouroboros]() leading to the discovery of Benzene's structure. For this connection it was important to
understand the closed circular structure of ouroboros; spatially. Just knowing the word wouldn't have been enough.

If language was enough, then [Mary Shelly]() needn't have lived in a forest to mend her personal life and in turn get inspiration for Frankeinstien. It should have been as easy
as switching a button on. But, it took a desolate, rainy, and isolated forest on top of a non-loyal husband for her to get into a state of mind to imagine an unforgiving and
cruel world that rejects everyone different.

And if just writing was enough, we would never have been able to figure out the nature of the universe. It took Galelio a lot of imagination, to understand relative positioning
of stars and to "imagine" the nature of our solar system. Physics and Math later developed, lead to complicated abstractions that take years for human experts to master lead to
better intuition, leading to better high-fidelity images in the mind which ultimately enable us to build rockets, and cars, and airplanes among other things.

It takes years for an engineer to develop intuition of good v/s bad designs, which when coupled with deep scientific expertise leads them to brainstorm, imagine and build things
previously unheard of. Without spatial understanding, along with familiarity of relevant technical concepts, engineers at SpaceX wouldn't have been able to figure out root causes
to their booster failures ultimately leading them to build reusable rockets.

Cognitive complexity then becomes a defining factor of intelligence. While language based AI is effective at superficially recalling information, and teaching us new things
individually, to be able to truly be called intelligent, it needs a way to deeply capture the nuances in any situation.

# Physics as Governing Rules

Imagination is a critical tool employed by intelligence. But, what are the governing principles that characterize imagination?

When you close your eyes, and imagine a chandelier, what do you see? Chances are that it is hanging from a wall, chances are that light is either being emmited from some internal
source or being refracted through with a high degree resemblance with its real world counterpart. You could argue that it follows physical laws of the world; otherwise why would
it be, atleast visually, conforming to known relativity and optical laws?

One could argue, what if we imagine it upside down? Your mind still follows the known physical laws. It just explicitly inverts spatially. Through basic spatial transformation
you could achieve similar results. But what if I imaging the chandelier being a ideal black body? It still doesn't diverge from the known physical laws. Firstly, you are mature
enough to understand a black body and by implication your mind is capable of visualizing it. Whatever conjurs up follows physical laws that you are familiar with.

The case of extrapolation, still can be argued to follow physical laws and work within well defined boundary conditions. Let's take two examples, that of a serpent eating it's
own tail (ouroboros) and second, a man flying in air (superman). For the former, its a acute theoritical possibility for a snake to eat it's own tail, and vanish into a thin
donut-singularity. It follows mass conservation during the start, and then in the extreme scenarios of an infinite "eating" sequence; abstract geometric patterns. For non-abstract
thinkers, the later part of the sequence would be a hard pill to swallow and the brain will have a hard time imagining (a sign that the uncertainty is very high) or in other words
it would know that the physical laws are breaking. For the latter,
